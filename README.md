# Winner-take-all-fails-to-account-for-pop-out-accuracy

This repository contains detailed simulations, results, and visual presentations, each organized by figure panel as specified in the associated research paper.

Folder Structure
Each subfolder is dedicated to a different figure from the research paper, for instance, "Figure 1A." 

Below is a breakdown of the typical contents of these subfolders:

Simulations: Contains all simulation scripts and settings necessary to reproduce the model behavior.
Results: Stores output from simulations including raw data files.
Data_Analysis: Scripts and utilities used for analyzing the simulation results.
Figure_Maker: Scripts that take analyzed data and produce the final visual representation as seen in the paper.
GraphicSettings.m: Settings file for all graphics related configurations.
PlottingData.m: Script used for plotting data in a manner consistent with the figure in the article.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to a Figure Folder: Each figure from the paper has a corresponding folder.
Run Simulations: Execute the simulation scripts in the 'Simulations' subfolder.
Analyze Results: Use scripts in the 'Data_Analysis' folder to process the results.
Generate Figures: Run the scripts in 'Figure_Maker' to create the figures based on the analyzed data.

Requirements
MATLAB R2023b or a compatible environment for running .m files.
Appropriate libraries and toolboxes specified in the script headers.
